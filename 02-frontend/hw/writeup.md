# This week, I learned a lot about front end development and how to use tools to make building a website easier and more efficent. Using Next.js is different from writing raw HTML or CSS because it handles a lot for me. With the raw version, you have to build everything from scratch. Next.js gives you a lot of features automatically which makes the process considerably more efficent. I'm also starting to understand how Typescript, Next.js, and Tailwind work together. Using these tools, the process of building websites are quicker and less confusing than having to do everything manually.
